You are an auto dealer who sells vehicles, more precisely cars, minibuses and motorbikes. You need a registry, in order to keep in track with vehicles.

Each vehicle has those properties:
-id
-brand
-year of production
-model
-color
-price
-horsepower
-fuel type

Cars, minibuses and motorbikes inherit the properties of vehicles, but add the mentioned properties and methods



The registry should have those functionalities:

- add a new vehicle
- remove a vehicle by ID
- sort vehicles by a given property
- filter vehicles by a given property ( for example return all vehicles with price greater than 35000)
- sum the price of vehicles


The auto dealer also has a configurator for parts. When ordering the user can add better parts, for example a more powerful engine, heated seats.
Each of these parts add to cost and can probably change properties(for example, a more powerful engine changes horsepower, additional color palettes change color)

Realise the logic with console first and then with winforms. Don`t forget to create a repo


The idea is practise the principles of OOP, unit testing and the decorator design pattern. You have one week starting 31.07.2025. Good luck
